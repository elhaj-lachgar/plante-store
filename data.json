Different fungi like Agrocybe, Marasmius oreades, and Lepiota species cause it. Fairy rings can be found on lawns worldwide. The size and shape of the rings depend on the fungus and environment. Common symptoms of the fairy ring include forming a ring pattern with vibrant or dead grass. Some fungi produce mushrooms without rings, while others create rings without mushrooms. This issue affects actively growing turf, including cool-season and Bermudagrass."

They release spores from mushrooms at the ring's edge, which can spread through air, animals, or water to create new colonies. The mycelia consume nutrients and cause the circular pattern to grow, resulting in fairy rings."

It is distributed worldwide and thrives in conditions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Infected plants exhibit grayish white, powdery growth on leaf surfaces, starting as isolated patches and spreading over larger areas. In advanced stages, affected leaves may turn yellow and become distorted. "

These spores can be carried by wind or other means to infect susceptible plants. Additionally, it reproduces asexually by producing conidia, which are airborne spores formed on the powdery growth of infected plants. These conidia can spread to new hosts, initiating new infections, and facilitating the rapid dissemination of the disease."

The fungi produce windborne spores called urediniospores, which infect the host plant through tiny openings called stomata. Moisture, like heavy dew, is needed for spore germination and infection.

It is responsible for causing Pierce's disease in grapevines and alfalfa dwarf disease, affecting a wide range of plant species and weeds. One notable symptom of almond leaf scorch is the distinct golden yellow color that severely infected tree canopies exhibit, leading to the disease being dubbed \"golden death.\" While affected almond trees can survive for several years, their overall health, growth, and productivity are significantly compromised."

Insects like leafhoppers and spittlebugs acquire the bacterium while feeding on infected plants and transmit it to healthy plants during subsequent feeding. Infected plants act as reservoirs, allowing the bacterium to persist and spread through insect activity or movement of infected plant material. Additionally, transmission can occur using contaminated grafting or pruning tools.\n"

This disease poses a substantial economic threat to apple growers due to potential crop losses. It appears as dark blotches or lesions on leaves, fruit, and occasionally young twigs. Infected young leaves can cause deformities, and affected trees may experience premature fruit drops."

In spring, the fungus releases spores into the air, which are carried by wind to new leaves, flowers, fruit, or twigs. Moisture on the plant surface is necessary for the spores to cause new infections. These infections develop into visible spots and produce more spores within 9 to 17 days. The spores are then spread by wind, rain, or irrigation, continuing the cycle of infection."

It is found worldwide in apple production regions. This disease can impact leaves, buds, shoots, blossoms, and fruit. Typical symptoms include whitish patches on the lower leaf surface, yellow spots on the upper surface, and a powdery appearance due to white spores. Leaves may exhibit curling and dropping, while buds become more vulnerable to winter damage. Infected fruit may develop a netlike russeting. "

It produces asexual spores called conidia, which spread through wind or insects, causing new infections. Under specific conditions, it forms sexual fruiting bodies called chasmothecia, which produce sexual spores called ascospores. These ascospores can survive tough conditions and infect plants in the following seasons. The ability to reproduce both ways helps powdery mildew survive, spread, and adapt as a plant disease."
